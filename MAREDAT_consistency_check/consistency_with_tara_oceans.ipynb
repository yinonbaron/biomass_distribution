    "# Consistency check between the MAREDAT data and *Tara* Oceans data\n",
    "Our estimates of the global biomass of several marine taxa are based on data from the MAREDAT database. As stated in the specific sections relying on data from the database, there are many sources of uncertainty associated with the estimates stemming from the MAREDAT data. Many of those sources of uncertainty are hard to quantify, and no uncertainty estimate is provided in the literature on estimates based on the MAREDAT database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we perform consistency checks for the MAREDAT data against independent sources of data, to increases our confidence in our estimates and to provide a measure of the uncertainty associated with our estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this document we conduct a comparison between the estimates of biomass based on the MAREDAT database and data from [de Vargas et al.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1261605). the data in de Vargas et al. is based on 18S rDNA sequencing of different populations of plankton collected by the *Tara* Oceans campaign. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset in de Vargas et al. divides the plankton community based on size ranges (pico-nano-, nano-, micro- and meso-plankton). de Vargas et al. provides only number of reads for each taxon. The fraction of reads that a taxon has out of the total number of reads can be used as a proxy for the biomass fraction of the taxon, but not as a proxy of its absolute biomass. Relying on 18S rDNA sequence abundance as a proxy for biomass is not a well established practice, and has its own biases, but we chose to use it for the sake of comparing it to independent approaches such as the MAREDAT database. Each plankton size fraction sampled in the study was sequenced to approximately the same sequencing depth (≈120 million reads). This means that the 18S read data can provide a possible proxy for the biomass fraction of a certain taxon within a size fraction, but not across size fractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We focus on comparing the MAREDAT and de Vargas et al. data in two case studies: the biomass of diatoms and the total biomass of nanoplakton and microplankton.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Diatoms\n",
    "We begin by describing how to compare the biomass estimates of diatoms based on de Vargas et al. and the MAREDAT dataset. Our aim is to calculate the relative fraction of diatoms out of the total biomass of organisms in the same size range as diatoms. As the data in those two datasets is structured differently, we first need to make corrections to the data so a valid comparison will be available.\n",
    "\n",
    "### MAREDAT\n",
    "In de Vargas et al., diatoms appear mainly in the nanoplankton (5-20 µm in diameter) and microplankton (20-180 µm) size fractions. In order to make a comparison to the MAREDAT database we need to find the corresponding groups in the MAREDAT database. The corresponding groups in the MAREDAT database are the microzooplankton and the diatom groups (zooplankton between 5 and 200 µm in diameter). As calculated in the marine protists sections, our estimates for the respective biomass of microzooplankton and diatoms are ≈0.6 Gt C and ≈0.3 Gt C. Thus, according to the MAREDAT data diatoms account for about 30% of the total biomass of plankton in the 5-200 µm size fraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### de Vargas et al.\n",
    "We use data on the total number of reads of different taxa in each size fraction. The data originates from de Vargas et al. from Database W6 in the companion website, as well as from Figure 3 in the main text. Here is a sample of the data:"
