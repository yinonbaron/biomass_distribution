    "# Estimating the biomass of marine arthropods\n",
    "To estimate the biomass of marine arthropods, we rely on data from the marine ecosystem biomass data (MAREDAT) initiative. The MAREDAT database contains measurements of the biomass concentration for each plankton group. From this database [Buitenhuis et al.](https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-5-227-2013) generates estimates for the global biomass of each plankton group by using a characteristic biomass concentration for each depth (either a median or average of the values in the database) and applying it across the entire volume of ocean at that depth.\n",
    "Buitenhuis et al. reports two estimates, one based on the arithmetic mean of concentrations at each depth, and one based on the median concentrations at each depth. The estimate based on the arithmetic mean is more susceptible to sampling bias, as even a single measurement which is not characteristic of the global population (such as samples which are in coastal waters, or samples which have some technical biases associated with them) might shift the average concentration significantly. On the other hand, the estimate based on the geometric mean might underestimate global biomass as it will reduce the effect of biologically relevant high biomass concentrations. As a compromise between these two caveats, we chose to use as our best estimate the geometric mean of the estimates from the two methodologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data in the MAREDAT database is divided into plankton size classes: microzooplankton (zooplankton between 5 and 200 µm in diameter), mesozooplankton (zooplankton between 200 and 2000 µm in diameter) and macrozooplankton (zooplankton between 2 and 10 mm). We are interested in the biomass of arthropods in each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Microzooplankton\n",
    "Microzooplankton was defined in the MAREDAT databased as to exclude copepod biomass, and thus its contribution to the total biomass of marine arthropods is neglegible.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mesozooplankton\n",
    "Mesozooplankton might contain several different kinds of animal and protist taxa. We argure that the main contribution to the mesozooplankton category in MAREDAT database comes from arthropods (mainly copepods). To substantiate this claim, we rely on 18S rDNA sequencing data from the *Tara* Oceans campaign reported in [de Vargas et al.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1261605). In figure W10A in the companion [website](http://taraoceans.sb-roscoff.fr/EukDiv/#figW10) to the paper the authors detail abundance of 18S rDNA reads for different animal and protist taxa:\n",

We provide two independent lines of evidence of the legitimacy of using the 18S data in de Vargas et al. in order to claim that arthropod dominate the biomass of mesozooplanktonin the MAREDAT data.\n",

    "Overall, we use ≈80% for the fraction of arthropods out of the total biomass of mesozooplankton in the MAREDAT database.\n",
    "\n",
    "To estimate the biomass of mesozooplankton arthropods, we rely on the global estimates made by [Buitenhuis et al.](http://search.proquest.com/openview/0e8e5672fa28111df473268e13f2f757/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=105729) based on the MAREDAT data. Buitenhuis et al. generated two estimates for the global biomass of mesozooplankton by using a characteristic biomass concentration for each depth (either a median or average of the values in the database) and applying it across the entire volume of ocean at that depth. This approach results in two types of estimates for the global biomass of mesozooplankton: a so called “minimum” estimate which uses the median concentration of biomass from the database, and a so called “maximum” estimate which uses the average biomass concentration. Because the distributions of values in the database are usually highly skewed by asymmetrically high values, the median and mean are loosely associated by the MAREDAT authors with a minimum and maximum estimate. The estimate based on the average value is more susceptible to biases in oversampling singular locations such as blooms of plankton species, or of coastal areas in which biomass concentrations are especially high, which might lead to an overestimate. On the other hand, the estimate based on the median biomass concentration might underestimate global biomass as it will reduce the effect of biologically relevant high biomass concentrations. Therefore, our best estimate of the biomass of mesozooplakton is the geometric mean of the “minimum” and “maximum” estimates. Buitenhuis et al. reports a \"minimum\" estimate of 0.33 Gt C and a \"maximum\" estimate of 0.59 Gt C. We calculate the geometric mean of those estimates:"
