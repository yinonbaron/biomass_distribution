    "# Estimating the biomass of molluscs\n",
    "To estimate the biomass of molluscs, we estimate the biomass of two major components of mollusc biomass - pteropods and cephalopods. In this work we assume the contribution of other types of molluscs is limited compared to pteropods and cephalopods.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pteropods\n",
    "Our estimate of the global biomass of pteropods is based on data from the MAREDAT database ([Buitenhuis et al.](http://search.proquest.com/openview/0e8e5672fa28111df473268e13f2f757/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=105729)). \n",
    "\n",
    "Buitenhuis et al. generated two estimates for the global biomass of pteropods by using a characteristic biomass concentration for each depth (either a median or average of the values in the database) and applying it across the entire volume of ocean at that depth. This approach results in two types of estimates for the global biomass of pteropods: a so called “minimum” estimate which uses the median concentration of biomass from the database, and a so called “maximum” estimate which uses the average biomass concentration. Because the distributions of values in the database are usually highly skewed by asymmetrically high values, the median and mean are loosely associated by the MAREDAT authors with a minimum and maximum estimate. The estimate based on the average value is more susceptible to biases in oversampling singular locations such as blooms of plankton species, or of coastal areas in which biomass concentrations are especially high, which might lead to an overestimate. On the other hand, the estimate based on the median biomass concentration might underestimate global biomass as it will reduce the effect of biologically relevant high biomass concentrations. Therefore, our best estimate of the biomass of pteropods is the geometric mean of the “minimum” and “maximum” estimates. Buitenhuis et al. reports a \"minimum\" estimate of 0.026 Gt C and a \"maximum\" estimate of 0.67 Gt C. We calculate the geometric mean of those estimates:"
