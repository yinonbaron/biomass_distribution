    "In each site Brum et al. sampled ≈100 phages, so the intra-site uncertainty should be much lower. Nevertheless, the uncertainty we calculated doesn’t take into consideration the fact that viruses from other environments might have different size ranges. Even though phages isolated from deep terrestrial deep subsurface seem to be in the same size range range ([Eydal et al.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ismej.2009.66)), we chose to use the 95% variability within each site as a measure of the uncertainty in the radius of a single pahge, to take into account possible variability of phage sizes in other environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "To propagate the uncertainty in the radius of a single phage into the uncertainty in the carbon content of a single phage, we use a numerical approach. We chose to use this approach as propagating the uncertainty in the radius of phages creates a probability distribution of the carbon content of a single phage which is not gaussian, and thus the uncertainty ranges a normal error propagation procedure will output will be non-informative. Namely, the additive standard error that we will get will be higher than the nominal estimate, but in reality there is no phage with a netagive radius length.\n",
    "Therefore, in order to quanitfy the uncertainty of the carbon content of a single phage stemming from the uncertainty in our estimate for the radius of a single phage, we sample 1000 times from a log-normal distribution of radii with a mean that is equal to our best estimate for the radius of a phage, and a multiplicative standard diviation which is equal to the uncertainty for the radius of a phage we project. We feed these sampled radii into our model and calculate a carbon content for each radius, resulting in a distribution of carbon content estimates. We take the multiplicative ratio between the 2.5% and 97.5% percentiles and our best estimate for the carbon content as our best estimate for the uncertainty of the carbon content of a single phage stemming from the uncertainty in our estimate for the radius of a single phage."
